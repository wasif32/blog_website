      "content": "Co-founders Matthew Prince and Michelle Zatlyn launched Cloudflare to the world during the Startup Battlefield competition at TechCrunch Disrupt back in 2010. Fast-forward 13 years, and the startup has grown to become a leading internet infrastructure and security company.\\n\\nOperating one of the largest global networks, Cloudflare services 275 cities in more than 100 countries. Roughly 18% of all websites use Cloudflare, including Netflix.com, NYTimes.com and Nih.gov to name but a few.\\n\\nWe’re excited to share that both Prince (CEO) and Zatlyn (president and COO) will join us for a fireside chat on the SaaS Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which takes place September 19–21. We’re especially excited because these days, it’s a rare event to have both co-founders appear together on one stage.\\n\\nWe’re eager to hear what life has been like as a public company — Prince and Zatlyn rang the New York Stock Exchange bell in 2019. We’ll get their take on growing the company beyond the core business to add products like Cloudflare Workers.\\n\\nWe’re also looking forward to their insights on how to keep growing and adjusting to changing markets and how they deal with competition from hyperclouds.\\n\\nIn addition to his roles at Cloudflare, Prince is a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer, and he serves on the Board of Advisors for the Center for Information Technology and Privacy Law.\\n\\nPrince holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and earned his J.D. from the University of Chicago. He’s also the co-creator of Project Honey Pot, the largest community of webmasters tracking online fraud and abuse.\\n\\nPrior to co-founding Cloudflare, Michelle Zatlyn held positions at Google and Toshiba, and launched two successful startups. Zatlyn currently serves on the board of directors for Atlassian and the World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders Foundation.\\n\\nZatlyn has been named to Fortune’s 40 Under 40 list, and she was part of Marie Claire’s 7th Annual New Guard. She holds a B.S. degree, with distinction, from McGill University and an MBA from Harvard Business School",

      "description": "10 fun links, including perfect pajamas and thoughts on mustaches...",
      "content": "What are you up to this weekend? Anton’s school has a block party tonight, so we’re going for hot dogs and bouncy castles. And tomorrow we might have a lemonade stand. Quick question: the other day, a kid in Brooklyn was selling small cups for $2.50 each (reader, I bought one), but the going rate is still around 50 cents, right? Hope you have a good one, and here are a few fun links from around the web… What’s your favorite dessert? Mine is chocolate mousse. Ooooh, looooove these pajamas. How to have dinner with your parents without diagnosing them with something, haha. Iceland is a magnet for tourists. “They say if you want to meet a Brit, go to a pub; if you want to meet a French person, go to a cafe. And definitely here in Iceland, you go to a swimming pool, because that’s where you can meet people — morning, afternoon or evening… they’re clean and affordable, and it’s something that all the locals do.” (NYTimes gift link) Plus, what it’s like to parent in Iceland. This nail color has a cult following. (Gemma was wearing it last night.) Conversations with NYC ladies in an elevator. Wouldn’t you love to hang with Julia Louis Dreyfus? An interview about improvising in the new movie You Hurt My Feelings: “That scene in which our son…has come home to say that he’s just broken up with his girlfriend, and then he goes stomping off to his room and he’s lying in bed. And I come in there and try to comfort him, and it doesn’t go well. He’s being…maybe petulant isn’t quite the right word, but he and I are not in sync, as often is the case between parent and child, right? I had an idea of how to end the scene: He should stop me on my way out and ask me if we had bagels in the house. I thought it would be a funny way to end the scene, and it would also be a window into the dynamic between this mother and son, the nurturing dynamic between the two of them, a kind of codependency that’s certainly in place. That’s just one line or two lines, but it did button the scene, so that was fun.” (Harper’s Bazaar) This font is so hard to read! God, I’m a sucker for mustaches. (NYTimes gift link) Plus, three reader comments: Says Ruth on four New York City Hall weddings: “When we were planning our wedding, I was proud of us for being able to use meaning as a guide for decision-making. The result was a perfect-for-us mix of people, beautiful outfits, the outdoors, and a bounty of food to honor our food-focused cultures, but also a relaxed vibe. Years later, friends — including grown-ups — still talk about the nap break we built into everyone’s day.” Says Samantha on what sunglasses do you wear: “I really like Goodr sunglasses. They’re cheap enough to not stress if you lose them, but high enough quality to protect your eyes and last a long time. Plus, the colors and names are so fun. I have Flamingos on a Booze Cruise!” Says Anna on my mom’s house in Michigan: “Gingham sheets, cheese for dinner, and grandchildren who love and are loved in return. I wish this for us all.”",

      "content": "So, I just booked a weekend trip to California with my mom, and I’m really excited. We’re going to explore San Francisco and spend a day in wine country. If you have any recommendations for things to do or places to eat, I’d love to hear them! In the meantime, here are some interesting links from around the web… Oh, hello! Have you seen any good movies lately? I really enjoyed The Father — it was beautifully acted and a touching portrayal of dementia. Plus, some fun reader comments on style regrets: Says Sarah: “Turtlenecks in all colors of the rainbow. I have a long neck, and they make me look like a turtle.” Says Katherine: “Low-rise jeans. Can you imagine how different everything will look in 20 years? I remember when my mom used to wear them, and I thought, how embarrassing. Now I’m thinking, how embarrassing.” Says Jaye: “Uncomfortable shoes and clothes. For the most part, if it’s not comfortable, I won’t wear it.” (P.S. Reader comments on bad moods and the books we read.) Say hello to Meraki, the Greek word for doing something with soul, creativity, or love — when you put “something of yourself” into what you’re doing. That’s what she’s doing in these gorgeous ceramics. These photos are pure joy. What a beautiful Airbnb in Joshua Tree. (NYTimes gift link) Plus, three reader comments: Says Maria on our family’s morning routine: “I love your reader’s comment about how it all sounds great except waking up before dawn. We are a 6:30 a.m. family for work and school. I wouldn’t trade my mornings for anything.” Says Dana on embracing nostalgia: “At a certain age, you let go of most trends and stick with what you’ve always loved, especially when it comes to home. I love old houses with soul, books with worn edges, things with patina, and designs with history. I feel it’s what gives a home character and a unique personality.” Says Mandy on hand-washing clothes: “I use Eucalan wool wash to hand wash all my nice clothes. It smells divine and is supposed to be great for your skin. Then I hang them on hangers and put them in the shower. It’s like giving them a little steam treatment and they’re dry by morning.”",

       "content": "Happy Friday! What are you up to this weekend? Toby has his last soccer game of the season, and I’m taking him out for a special lunch afterwards. I also want to check out a new bakery that just opened in our neighborhood. In the meantime, here are a few fun links from around the web… We’re going to see The Conjuring tonight. Have you seen any good scary movies lately? We just watched The Witch and loved it. What a fascinating time in American history. Would you ever try a 10-step Korean skin-care routine? How to make your own perfume. Are you reading anything good? I’m currently reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. It’s a thought-provoking look at the history and future of humanity. These tote bags are great for summer. I’m obsessed with this wallpaper. (NYTimes gift link) Plus, three reader comments: Says Sue on how do you handle stress: “I take a long shower, go for a walk, or do a puzzle. Sometimes I write a thank-you note or do something nice for someone else. These things help me slow down and realize that everything will be okay. And I don’t mean ‘Everything will be okay’ like someone who is absentmindedly saying it because they don’t know what else to say. I really mean ‘Everything will be okay’ because I know that even if things are falling apart, it’s not the end of the world. Life will go on and good things will happen.” Says Kathleen on seven great reader comments: “I love comments that take me on a roller coaster ride of emotions and teach me something along the way. The ones that make me laugh out loud, gasp in shock, wipe away tears, or sit in stunned silence, just trying to process it all. The ones that remind me that the world is full of beautifully diverse people with fascinating stories and a lot of wisdom to share. Thank you, Cup of Jo readers, for being so amazing!” Says Alisha on why do we love stories about teenagers: “We all secretly wish we could be a teenager again. When life was simple, when we had our whole lives ahead of us. When all we worried about was who would ask us to prom, whether our best friend was going to talk to the guy we liked, or how we were going to explain to our parents why we were late coming home from the movies. It’s not about the teenage years themselves; it’s about the promise and potential that they represent.”",
